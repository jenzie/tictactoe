===============
For this research project, a limited amount of time was given to conduct
research on basic Tic-Tac-Toe strategies and AI/algorithms for non-human
players. As a result, this project may not be complete due to time constraints,
with regards to the designing, testing, and documenting of said project.

The project itself has the following completed:
- The abstract Player class.
- The HumanPlayer that extends Player.
- The RandomAIPlayer that extends Player.
- The OkayAIPlayer that extends Player.
- The Board class that mimics an actual board with fixed, given dimensions.
- The Tic-Tac-Toe class that runs the game using the Board and Player(s).
- The RandomAIPlayerTest and OkayAIPlayerTest that tests chooseMove() from
  their respective Player class.

The project itself has the following in progress:
- The GoodAIPlayer that extends Player.
- The GoodAIPlayerTest that tests chooseMove() from GoodAIPlayer.
